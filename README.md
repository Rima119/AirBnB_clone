# AirBnB_clone
The AirBnB clone project is an Alx Software Engineering School Project. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple clone or copy of the famous AirBnB website. This is totally for educational purposes ONLY.

We are to complete this project in groups of two. This group comprises of Rim El Filali and Ousmane Konate. We wonâ€™t have to implement all the features of the original Airbnb, only some of them to cover and fulfill all fundamental concepts of the Alx School higher level programming track.

# At the end of the project, we would be completing a web application composed by:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

A database or files that store data (data = objects)

An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

# Concepts to learn from doing this project

Unittest - we work all together on test cases

Python packages

Serialization/Deserialization

*args, **kwargs

datetime
